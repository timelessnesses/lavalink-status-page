# status page for lavalink

yeah im getting good at front-end now :pog:

## setup

1. Run gen.py file to generate index.js file
2. You can either host it in your own way or use flask application (app.py)

## common issues
Q: I can't get my status page working with my custom hosting like django/flask/express!  

A: Yeah you likely need to make your custom hosting to have access files inside the folder you want to host it.  
Or another problem is you CAN'T do status page to use https and lavalink hosting to use http due to chrome security reasons! You should however make those http or https!
